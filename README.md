# DeepLearning

This was a class project completed by my groupmates and I in the Fall 2019 quarter.

Using the MURA dataset from Stanford, my group implemented three Convolutional Neural Network to train and predict whether a bone image is normal or abnormal.

The first model that we implemented was a simple 5-layer CNN, second model was a complex 23-layer CNN, and the last model we implemented for this project involved Transfer Learning with MobileNet version 2.
